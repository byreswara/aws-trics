lsblk  (it shows the volumes and find the newly attached volume. it will be like 'xvdf or xvdf1')

mkdir  /mnt/recovery  (creat a directory)

mount  /dev/xvdf1  /mnt/recovery  (create a mount point)

lsblk  (you can find mount point for xvdf1)

cat  /home/ec2-user/.ssh/authorized_keys  > /mnt/recovery/home/ec2-user/.ssh/authorized_keys
     (it append or update the keys)

umount /mnt/recovery     (unmount the volume)
